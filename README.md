# Kaggle Playground Series Season 5
Welcome to my repository for the Kaggle Playground Series Season 5! This repository will serve as a centralized hub for my work on the competitions hosted as part of this series.

## Overview

The Kaggle Playground Series is a monthly machine learning competition series aimed at providing interesting and approachable datasets for the Kaggle community to practice their skills and build experience with real-world problems. The competitions are open to beginners and experts alike, making them an excellent opportunity to learn, experiment, and grow.

## Current Competition: Playground Series - Season 5, Episode 1 (S5E1)

### Competition Details

Description: The first competition of Season 5 offers a compelling dataset to explore and model. The task is designed to test participants' ability to build and evaluate machine learning models while maintaining an approachable level of complexity.

Start Date: January 2025

End Date: February 2025

Goals for S5E1

Perform thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Experiment with a variety of machine learning models.

Optimize hyperparameters and compare performance metrics.

Document insights and strategies used during the competition.

### Future Competitions

This repository will be continuously updated with additional competitions in the series as they are announced. Each competition will have its own dedicated folder, following a similar structure to ensure consistency and organization.
